Project Overview
I analyzed a dataset containing over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. The project focused on extracting insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. I tackled a variety of real-world business challenges through advanced SQL queries, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory optimization.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis, I performed the following tasks:

Duplicate Removal: Identified and eliminated duplicate entries in the customer and order tables.

Null Handling:

Missing customer addresses were replaced with default placeholders.

Null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”

Null return dates were retained, as not all orders were returned.

Project Objective
The core goal was to apply advanced SQL to solve practical e-commerce business problems. Key analysis areas included:

Customer purchase patterns

Product sales performance

Inventory management insights

Payment and shipping behavior

Forecasting and return analysis

Key Business Problems Identified

Inconsistent product restocking led to low availability.

Certain product categories had high return rates.

Shipment delays and irregular delivery times were prevalent.

High customer acquisition costs were coupled with low retention.

Key Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I:

Designed and worked with a normalized relational database.

Cleaned and preprocessed real-world datasets effectively.

Applied advanced SQL techniques including window functions, CTEs, subqueries, and complex joins.

Conducted comprehensive business analysis using SQL.

Optimized queries for performance on large datasets.

Conclusion
This advanced SQL project showcases my ability to apply structured queries to address complex business challenges in the e-commerce space. From enhancing customer retention strategies to improving inventory and logistics, the project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can be made using SQL. It strengthened both my technical and analytical skills, offering practical exposure to solving real-world problems.
